# No longer maintained
Scam Buddy will no longer be maintained because I am no longer interested in scambaiting, and as a direct result, I don't have the drive to maintain this extension.

If you would like to make updates to the extension, please consider creating a fork of the repository! You are welcome to work on your own updates and distribute the extension as you see fit.

Thank you to those who've shown me support for creating this. ❤️
